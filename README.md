## What I Learned

Building this "flutter_simple_calculator" app focused on understanding stateful widgets and basic state management in Flutter:

* **Understanding `StatefulWidget`:**
    * This project introduced me to the concept of `StatefulWidget` and why it's crucial for building dynamic UIs in Flutter.
    * I learned that `StatefulWidget`s can change over time, allowing the UI to update in response to user interactions or other events.

* **Simple State Management:**
    * I gained practical experience with managing the state of my calculator app.
    * I learned how to declare variables within the `State` class of a `StatefulWidget` to hold the current state (e.g., the numbers being entered, the current operation, and the result).
    * I implemented logic to update this state when buttons are clicked (number buttons, operation buttons, equals button).
    * I saw how calling `setState()` triggers a rebuild of the widget, causing the UI to reflect the updated state (displaying the numbers and the calculated answer).
